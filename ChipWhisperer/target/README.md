## Usage

This submodule is used to manage the code and resources related to a specific feature or module. It's important to maintain a clear structure and organization within this directory to ensure that the code remains manageable and easy to maintain.

The `Legacy` directory contains code that needs to be refactored or removed. This directory should be used for code that is no longer needed or has been superseded by newer versions.

The `Dilithium` directory contains the latest code of different Dilithium target. The `Kyber` directory contains the latest code of different Kyber target. The `Falcon` directory contains the latest code of different Falcon target. The `Sphincs` directory contains the latest code of different Sphincs target.

The `README.md` file provides documentation for this submodule. It should include information about the purpose of this submodule, its dependencies, and how to use it.

To use this submodule, you can simply include it in your project by referencing its directory.Copy and paste the target code you want to the ChipWhisperer/hardware/victims/firmware, then the scripts are ready to go. Make sure to update the `README.md` file with any relevant information about the submodule.
